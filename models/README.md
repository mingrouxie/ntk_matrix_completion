# Models
- binary_class_regress: Binary classification then regression for only loading
- knn: k nearest neighbors, can handle both energy and loading
- multitask: NN both sep and corr to predict energy and loading simultaneously
- neural_tangent_kernel: well
- two_tower_nn: well
- xgboost: was only energy, will extend to loading soon as well (separate model, and if time permits, coupled model)
