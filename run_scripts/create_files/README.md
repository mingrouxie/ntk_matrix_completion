    - daniels_data/science_paper
    - priors/science_paper
    - priors/iza_all_no_nb/ and iza_lit and iza_hyp based on truths/XX where XX is the same folder name
- create_files_2.sh
    - creates 221216/science truth files
- create_files_3.sh
    - creates 221216/iza_all truth files
    - actually just the before non-binding, since the matrix is not full 
- create_files_4.sh
    - create prior files from 221216/iza_all/mean/truth_before_nb truth file
- create_files_5_zach.sh
    - create prior files from science + zach subset truth files (which is in total a full matrix)
- create_files_6.sh
    - create prior files from truths/testing_3, for code debugging purposes
- create_files_7.sh
    - re-extract data (test) after changing create_truth to resolve Loading data not extracted properly issue
    - see matrix_completion_analysis/create_files/analysis1 for details
- create_hyp_osda_priors.sh
    - create the prior files in data/priors/221221_hyp_osdas_omar/ and data/priors/221221_hyp_osdas_others/ and data/priors/2021_apriori_dskoda (last one is not there??)
- create_zeolite_files.sh
    - all 3 groups
